# RadFil
Radfil is a radial density profile building and fitting tool for interstellar filaments. All you need to build a radial density profile for our own filaments is an image array and a mask array. Radfil can do the rest! Please see the tutorial for a complete working example of the code. 

If you have any questions, or find a bug, please feel free to email me at catherine.zucker@cfa.harvard.edu!
