# RadFil
Radfil is a radial density profile building and fitting tool for interstellar filaments. All you need to build a radial density profile of your own filaments is an image array (with fits header), a mask array, and a distance. Radfil can do the rest! Please see the tutorial for a complete working example of the code. 

Update: 1/25/2016: While developed using HiGAL data, RadFil is currently undergoing testing for filaments of all size scales and image resolutions (from both observational and synthetic data). We are also working to improve the user interface and add more features. Feel free to download and run the code but please check back soon for the final "friendliest" version!

If you have any questions, or find a bug, please feel free to email me at catherine.zucker@cfa.harvard.edu!
